Easy Duplicate Finder uses advanced file comparison algorithms to scan your drives and folders for duplicates. You can choose from different scan modes depending on what kind of files you want to find. For example, you can use the Music Scan mode to find duplicate songs by artist, title, or album. Or you can use the Outlook Scan mode to find duplicate emails and contacts in your Outlook account.
 
Once the scan is complete, Easy Duplicate Finder will show you a list of all the duplicate files it found. You can preview the files before deleting them, or use the Auto-Select feature to let the program choose the best files to keep. You can also move the duplicates to another folder, rename them, or export them to a CSV file.
 
Easy Duplicate Finder is not a free program, but you can download a trial version that lets you delete up to 10 groups of duplicates. To unlock the full functionality of the program, you need to buy a license key that costs $39.95 for one PC or Mac. However, you can also find some websites that offer cracked versions of Easy Duplicate Finder with serial license keys for free. But be careful, as these websites may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
 
If you want to install Easy Duplicate Finder on another computer without losing your license key, you need to deactivate it first on your current computer. To do that, you need to open the program and go to Menu > License > Deactivate License. Then you can install the program on another computer and activate it with the same license key.
 
Easy Duplicate Finder is a great solution for finding and removing duplicate files from your PC or Mac. It can help you free up disk space, organize your folders, and improve your computer's performance. You can download it from the official website or from some other sources, but make sure you have a valid license key or a reliable crack to use it without limitations.
